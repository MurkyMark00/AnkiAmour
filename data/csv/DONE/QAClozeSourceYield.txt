Vertigo originating from the brainstem or cerebellum is classified as {{c1::central vertigo}}.|Causes of central vertigo include ischemic events (stroke), tumors, demyelination (MS), and toxic/metabolic disorders.

What does Videonystagmography (VNG) measure?<br>{{c1::Eye movements (nystagmus) using infrared cameras.}}|VNG is a diagnostic test that records involuntary eye movements (nystagmus). This allows for a more detailed and objective analysis of the vestibular system's function, including saccades, smooth pursuit, and responses to caloric and positional testing. Source: Slide 13.|MediumYield Test::20-Bas_Donmesi
What is the purpose of caloric testing?<br>{{c1::To assess the function of the horizontal semicircular canal and its afferent pathways on each side independently.}}|Warm (+7°C from body temp) and cool (-7°C from body temp) water or air is introduced into the ear canal. This creates a temperature gradient that induces endolymph flow and nystagmus. The mnemonic <b>COWS</b> (Cold Opposite, Warm Same) describes the direction of the fast phase of nystagmus in a normal individual. A reduced or absent response indicates a peripheral vestibular weakness on that side (canal paresis). Source: Slide 14.|HighYield Test::20-Bas_Donmesi

A single, severe vertigo episode lasting for <b>days</b> is characteristic of which two conditions?<br>{{c1::Vestibular Neuronitis and Labyrinthitis}}|The primary distinction between the two is hearing status. Labyrinthitis involves inflammation of the entire labyrinth, causing both vertigo and hearing loss. Vestibular neuronitis is inflammation of the vestibular nerve only, so hearing is normal.

Vertigo triggered by coughing, loud noises, or pressure changes (Valsalva) is suggestive of what condition?<br>{{c1::Perilymphatic fistula or Third Window Syndrome (e.g., Superior Canal Dehiscence)}}|These maneuvers increase intracranial or middle ear pressure, which can abnormally stimulate the vestibular system if a fistula or dehiscence is present. This is known as the Tullio phenomenon (for sound) or Hennebert's sign (for pressure). Source: Slide 19, 81.|HighYield Test::20-Bas_Donmesi
What is oscillopsia?<br>{{c1::The illusion of environmental movement or bouncing, often experienced during head movement.}}|Oscillopsia is a hallmark symptom of <b>bilateral vestibulopathy</b>. Patients have a deficient vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR), so their eyes cannot remain stable during head motion, causing the visual world to appear to jump or bob.

What is nystagmus?<br>{{c1::A repetitive, involuntary, biphasic (slow and fast phase) movement of the eyes.}}|Nystagmus is the single most important objective finding in a patient with vertigo. The direction of nystagmus is named after its fast phase. In peripheral vestibular lesions, the fast phase typically beats away from the side of the lesion (towards the more active side). Source: Slide 20.|HighYield Test::20-Bas_Donmesi
According to Alexander's Law, spontaneous nystagmus from a peripheral vestibular lesion will increase in intensity when the patient looks in which direction?<br>{{c1::In the direction of the fast phase.}}|For example, a left vestibular lesion will cause a right-beating nystagmus. According to Alexander's Law, this nystagmus will be most prominent when the patient looks to the right. This is a classic feature of peripheral nystagmus. Source: Slide 21.|HighYield Test::20-Bas_Donmesi
What is the purpose of using Frenzel goggles or video-oculography?<br>{{c1::To prevent visual fixation, which allows for better observation of nystagmus.}}|Visual fixation can suppress peripheral nystagmus. Frenzel goggles use high-powered (+20 diopter) magnifying lenses and internal lighting to blur the patient's vision, thus eliminating fixation and making nystagmus more apparent to the examiner. Source: Slide 22, 23.|MediumYield Test::20-Bas_Donmesi
What type of vertigo is indicated if nystagmus is NOT suppressed by visual fixation?<br>{{c1::Central vertigo}}|The inability to suppress nystagmus with visual fixation, often tested by having the patient focus on a target (like the examiner's thumb), is a strong indicator of a central nervous system lesion. This is often due to a defect in smooth pursuit pathways, commonly seen in cerebellar disorders. Source: Slide 23.|HighYield Test::20-Bas_Donmesi
Downbeating nystagmus is most commonly associated with lesions in what anatomical region?<br>{{c1::The craniocervical junction (e.g., Arnold-Chiari malformation) or cerebellum.}}|Downbeating nystagmus is almost always a sign of a central lesion. Other causes include spinocerebellar degeneration, drug toxicity (anticonvulsants, lithium), and magnesium or B12 deficiency. Source: Slide 24.|HighYield Test::20-Bas_Donmesi
Upbeating nystagmus is considered a sign of what type of pathology?<br>{{c1::Central pathology (e.g., brainstem or cerebellar lesions).}}|Upbeating nystagmus is definitively a central sign.

Source: Slide 25.|HighYield Test::20-Bas_Donmesi
What is Gaze-Evoked Nystagmus (GEN)?<br>{{c1::Nystagmus that appears when the eyes are moved away from the primary position into an eccentric gaze.}}|GEN is caused by an inability to maintain eccentric gaze, a function managed by a 'neural integrator' in the brainstem. A 'leaky' integrator causes the eyes to drift back to center (slow phase), followed by a corrective saccade back to the target (fast phase). If the nystagmus changes direction with the direction of gaze, it is a strong sign of a central lesion. Source: Slide 26.|MediumYield Test::20-Bas_Donmesi
What is See-Saw Nystagmus?<br>{{c1::A disconjugate nystagmus where one eye elevates and intorts while the other eye depresses and extorts, with the movements alternating.}}|This is a rare and specific type of central nystagmus.

What is the Head Impulse Test (HIT) or Head Thrust Test?<br>{{c1::A clinical test of the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) used to identify a peripheral vestibular deficit.}}|The examiner asks the patient to fixate on their nose and then performs a small, rapid, unpredictable head turn. A normal response (negative test) is for the eyes to remain fixed on the target. An abnormal response (positive test) is when the eyes are dragged with the head, followed by a corrective saccade back to the target, indicating a deficient VOR on the side to which the head was turned.

In a patient with acute vertigo, what is the significance of a POSITIVE (abnormal) Head Impulse Test?<br>{{c1::It strongly suggests a <b>peripheral</b> vestibular lesion (e.g., vestibular neuronitis).}}|A positive test, characterized by a corrective saccade, indicates that the VOR is impaired on the side of the head thrust.

In a patient with acute vertigo, what is the significance of a NEGATIVE (normal) Head Impulse Test?<br>{{c1::It is a red flag that suggests a <b>central</b> cause (e.g., stroke), as the peripheral reflex arc is intact.}}|This is a key component of the HINTS exam. If a patient has ongoing vertigo and nystagmus but a normal Head Impulse Test, it implies the VOR is working correctly and the lesion must be central. This is considered a 'dangerous' sign.

A positive Head Impulse Test in both directions indicates what condition?<br>{{c1::Bilateral labryrinthine/vestibular hypofunction.}}|This condition, known as bilateral vestibulopathy, can be caused by aging, ototoxic drugs (especially gentamicin), or autoimmune disorders.

It causes a brief, latency-induced nystagmus that resolves as the particles settle. Cupulolithiasis causes a more persistent nystagmus that lasts as long as the head is in the provoking position because the weighted cupula remains deflected.

Which semicircular canal is most commonly affected in BPPV?<br>{{c1::The posterior semicircular canal (~90% of cases).}}|The posterior canal's dependent position when a person is supine makes it the most likely location for otoconia to collect due to gravity.
