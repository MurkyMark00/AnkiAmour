What is the core definition of glaucoma?<br>It is a {{c1::chronic, progressive optic neuropathy}} characterized by a specific pattern of optic nerve head cupping and visual field loss.|<b>Pathophysiology:</b> The primary mechanism is the loss of <b>retinal ganglion cells (RGCs)</b> and their axons, which form the optic nerve. This leads to characteristic changes.<br><b>Important Note:</b> Glaucoma is <i>NOT</i> synonymous with high intraocular pressure (IOP). High IOP is the most significant risk factor, but glaucoma can occur at any IOP level (high, normal, or even low).|HighYield Test::10-Glokom_09.51.02

Describe the basic classification of glaucoma.<br>Glaucoma is first classified as <b>Primary</b> (idiopathic) or <b>Secondary</b> (due to another cause like trauma, steroids, or uveitis).<br>Both types are then sub-classified based on the iridocorneal angle anatomy as {{c1::<b>Open-Angle</b>}} or {{c1::<b>Closed-Angle (or Angle-Closure)</b>}}.|<b>Open-Angle Glaucoma:</b> The drainage angle is anatomically open, but the trabecular meshwork is dysfunctional, leading to increased resistance and elevated IOP.<br><b>Closed-Angle Glaucoma:</b> The peripheral iris physically blocks the trabecular meshwork, preventing aqueous humor from draining.|HighYield Test::10-Glokom_09.51.02
What refractive error is a risk factor for open-angle glaucoma?<br>{{c1::Myopia (nearsightedness)}}.|The exact mechanism is not fully understood but may relate to structural changes in the optic nerve head and lamina cribrosa in myopic eyes, making them more susceptible to glaucomatous damage.|HighYield Test::10-Glokom_09.51.02
What refractive error is a risk factor for closed-angle glaucoma?<br>{{c1::Hyperopia (farsightedness)}}.|<b>Mechanism:</b> Hyperopic eyes are typically smaller and have a shallower anterior chamber. This anatomical configuration brings the iris closer to the cornea, narrowing the drainage angle and predisposing the individual to angle closure.|HighYield Test::10-Glokom_09.51.02
What is the most common type of glaucoma worldwide?<br>{{c1::Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma (POAG)}}.|POAG is particularly prevalent in individuals of African descent. In contrast, Primary Angle-Closure Glaucoma is more common in individuals of East Asian descent.|HighYield Test::10-Glokom_09.51.02
What is ocular hypertension?<br>{{c1::Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) > 21 mmHg}} without any detectable signs of glaucomatous optic nerve damage or visual field loss.|Patients with ocular hypertension are at an increased risk of developing primary open-angle glaucoma. The decision to treat is based on a risk assessment that considers factors like IOP level, corneal thickness, age, and family history.|HighYield Test::10-Glokom_09.51.02

What are the four essential components of a diagnostic glaucoma workup?<br>1. {{c1::Intraocular pressure measurement (Tonometry)}}<br>2. {{c1::Optic nerve head examination}}<br>3. {{c1::Evaluation of the drainage angle (Gonioscopy)}}<br>4. {{c1::Visual field assessment (Perimetry)}}|This comprehensive evaluation is necessary to diagnose glaucoma, determine its type (open vs. closed angle), and establish a baseline for monitoring progression.|MediumYield Test::10-Glokom_09.51.02
In glaucoma diagnosis, what is considered the most valuable parameter, even though it signifies that damage has already occurred?<br>{{c1::Visible changes in the optic disc}}.|<b>Clinical Significance:</b> While IOP measurement is crucial for management, the definitive diagnosis of glaucoma relies on identifying structural damage to the optic nerve. By the time changes like increased cupping or notching are visible, a significant number of retinal ganglion cells have already been lost. This underscores the importance of early detection.|HighYield Test::10-Glokom_09.51.02
What is the gold standard method for measuring intraocular pressure (IOP)?<br>{{c1::Goldmann Applanation Tonometry (GAT)}}.|<b>Principle:</b> GAT works based on the Imbert-Fick principle, which states that the pressure inside an ideal sphere is equal to the force required to flatten a small area of its surface. The procedure involves a topical anesthetic, fluorescein dye, a cobalt blue light, and a tonometer tip that gently flattens the cornea. The endpoint is when the inner edges of the two fluorescein semi-circles (mires) touch.|HighYield Test::10-Glokom_09.51.02
What is the normal range for intraocular pressure (IOP) in the general population, and what is the typical diurnal variation?<br>Normal range is typically {{c1::10-21 mmHg}}. Diurnal variation is usually {{c1::4-5 mmHg}} and should not exceed 5 mmHg in a healthy eye.|<b>Physiology:</b> IOP tends to be highest in the early morning hours. A large diurnal fluctuation can be a risk factor for glaucoma progression. IOP can be transiently increased by the Valsalva maneuver and may decrease by about 10% during pregnancy.|HighYield Test::10-Glokom_09.51.02
What is the primary purpose of gonioscopy in a glaucoma evaluation?<br>{{c1::To differentiate between open-angle and closed-angle glaucoma}} by directly visualizing the iridocorneal angle structures.|This distinction is critical as the management for open-angle and closed-angle glaucoma is fundamentally different.

Which type of perimetry is preferred for detecting and monitoring glaucoma, and why?<br>{{c1::Static automated perimetry (e.g., Humphrey Visual Field Analyzer)}} is preferred over kinetic perimetry (e.g., Goldmann).|<b>Reasoning:</b> Static perimetry is more sensitive for detecting the subtle, early visual field defects characteristic of glaucoma. It tests specific points in the visual field with light stimuli of varying intensity, providing a quantitative map of retinal sensitivity. Kinetic perimetry, which uses a moving target, is less sensitive and typically identifies defects only when they are more advanced.|HighYield Test::10-Glokom_09.51.02
Which retinal nerve fibers are typically affected first in glaucoma, and which are spared until late stages?<br>The {{c1::arcuate nerve fibers}} (superior and inferior) are most vulnerable and affected early. The {{c1::papillomacular bundle}}, which serves central vision, is relatively resistant and spared until late in the disease.|This anatomical vulnerability explains the clinical course of glaucoma. Damage to the arcuate fibers leads to peripheral visual field defects like arcuate scotomas and nasal steps, while the preservation of the papillomacular bundle allows the patient to maintain good central visual acuity until the disease is very advanced.|HighYield Test::10-Glokom_09.51.02
What is a nasal step on a visual field test, and why does it occur?<br>A nasal step is a {{c1::step-like defect in the nasal visual field that respects the horizontal meridian}}. It occurs because the temporal arcuate nerve fibers, which are often damaged in glaucoma, do not cross the horizontal raphe of the retina.|The damage to the superior or inferior temporal nerve fiber bundles results in a corresponding defect in the inferior or superior nasal visual field, respectively. The sharp border at the horizontal midline is a classic sign of a glaucomatous (or at least neurologic) visual field defect.|MediumYield Test::10-Glokom_09.51.02
What is an arcuate scotoma (or Bjerrum scotoma)?<br>It is an {{c1::arch-shaped visual field defect}} that starts at the blind spot, arches over the macula in the superior or inferior field, and ends at the horizontal raphe nasally.|This classic glaucomatous defect directly corresponds to damage to the arcuate nerve fiber bundle.

On an OCT RNFL analysis, what is the 'double hump' pattern, and what is its significance in glaucoma?<br>The 'double hump' refers to the normal TSNIT plot pattern where the RNFL is thickest {{c1::superiorly and inferiorly}}. In glaucoma, the loss of arcuate fibers causes these {{c1::humps to flatten and thin}}, which is a key quantitative sign of damage.|The TSNIT plot graphs the RNFL thickness in quadrants: Temporal, Superior, Nasal, Inferior, Temporal.

What is a disc hemorrhage (Drance hemorrhage) and what is its clinical significance in glaucoma?<br>A disc hemorrhage is a {{c1::small, flame-shaped hemorrhage}} located on or near the optic disc margin. Its presence is a strong risk factor for {{c1::glaucoma development or progression}}, especially in normal-tension glaucoma.|These hemorrhages are often transient, lasting only a few weeks.

What is pseudoexfoliation syndrome, and how does it cause secondary glaucoma?<br>It is a systemic condition, common in the elderly, characterized by the deposition of a {{c1::white, flaky, dandruff-like material}} on various structures in the anterior segment. It causes glaucoma by {{c1::clogging the trabecular meshwork}}, which obstructs aqueous outflow and raises IOP.|Clinical signs include the classic 'bull's-eye' pattern on the anterior lens capsule, scalloped pupil margin, and pigment deposition on the angle structures (Sampaolesi's line). This type of glaucoma is often aggressive and difficult to control.|HighYield Test::10-Glokom_09.51.02
What is pigment dispersion syndrome, and what is the typical patient profile?<br>Pigment dispersion syndrome occurs when the posterior iris rubs against the lens zonules, liberating pigment.

The typical patient is a {{c1::young, myopic male}}.|Classic signs include radial, spoke-like transillumination defects in the mid-peripheral iris, a Krukenberg spindle (vertical pigment deposition on the corneal endothelium), and heavy, uniform pigmentation of the trabecular meshwork on gonioscopy.|HighYield Test::10-Glokom_09.51.02
What is neovascular glaucoma, and what are the two most common underlying causes?<br>Neovascular glaucoma (NVG) is a severe, often painful secondary glaucoma caused by the growth of abnormal new blood vessels (neovascularization) on the iris and in the drainage angle. The two most common causes are {{c1::proliferative diabetic retinopathy}} and {{c1::central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO)}}.|<b>Pathophysiology:</b> Widespread retinal ischemia leads to the overproduction of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), which stimulates neovascularization. These vessels form a fibrovascular membrane that contracts and pulls the peripheral iris forward, causing synechial angle closure.

Handwritten notes mention that the vestibular system sends approximately 160 stimuli per second to the brain.|HighYield Test::20-Bas_Donmesi
The semicircular canals are responsible for detecting {{c1::angular (rotational) head movements}}, while the otolith organs (utricle and saccule) detect {{c2::linear acceleration and gravity}}.|This functional division is crucial. Dysfunction of the semicircular canals typically causes rotational vertigo, which is vital for the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR). Otolith dysfunction can cause feelings of tilting or linear displacement.|MediumYield Test::20-Bas_Donmesi
What is the primary function of the Vestibulo-Ocular Reflex (VOR)?<br>{{c1::To maintain stable vision by keeping the gaze fixed on a target (on the fovea) during head movements.}}|<b>Mechanism:</b> The VOR generates eye movements of equal velocity but opposite direction to head movements. A dysfunctional VOR results in <b>oscillopsia</b>, the sensation that the environment is bouncing or jiggling with head movement.|HighYield Test::20-Bas_Donmesi
Nystagmus consists of two components: a {{c1::slow phase}} driven by the VOR, and a {{c2::fast phase}} which is a corrective saccade. By clinical convention, the direction of nystagmus is named after its {{c3::fast phase}}.|"<b>Clinical Pearl:</b> The slow phase points towards the side of the pathological (hypoactive) labyrinth, while the fast phase beats away from it, towards the more neurally active side. The fast phase is easier to see clinically, hence the naming convention. A handwritten note emphasizes that nystagmus is the ""only objective sign"" of vertigo."|HighYield Test::20-Bas_Donmesi

How can you differentiate Vestibular Neuronitis from Labyrinthitis?<br>{{c1::Both present with acute, severe vertigo lasting for days. Labyrinthitis involves <b>both</b> vestibular and cochlear symptoms (i.e., hearing loss and/or tinnitus), whereas in Vestibular Neuronitis, auditory function is preserved.}}|A handwritten note on the slide clarifies that Vestibular Neuronitis is inflammation of the balance nerve, whereas Labyrinthitis involves the entire labyrinth (cochlea + vestibule).|HighYield Test::20-Bas_Donmesi
Vertigo triggered by specific head movements (e.g., rolling in bed, looking up) is characteristic of {{c1::BPPV}}.|In contrast, vertigo triggered by loud noises (Tullio phenomenon) or pressure changes (Hennebert sign) suggests a third window syndrome like Superior Canal Dehiscence or perilymph fistula.|HighYield Test::20-Bas_Donmesi
What is Alexander's Law regarding peripheral vestibular nystagmus?<br>{{c1::The intensity of the nystagmus increases when the patient's gaze is directed towards the fast phase, and decreases when directed towards the slow phase.}}|<b>Example:</b> In left vestibular neuronitis, the nystagmus is right-beating. It will be most intense on right gaze, less intense on primary gaze, and may be absent on left gaze. Gaze-evoked nystagmus that changes direction (e.g., right-beating on right gaze, left-beating on left gaze) violates Alexander's law and is a sign of a central lesion.|HighYield Test::20-Bas_Donmesi
What is the purpose of using Frenzel goggles in a vestibular examination?<br>{{c1::To prevent visual fixation, which allows the examiner to observe underlying peripheral nystagmus that would otherwise be suppressed by the patient's gaze.}}|Frenzel goggles are high-powered (+20 diopter) magnifying lenses that blur vision while illuminating the eyes, making them essential for a thorough bedside vestibular exam.|HighYield Test::20-Bas_Donmesi

What is the purpose of the Head Impulse Test (HIT), and what does an abnormal (positive) result signify?<br>{{c1::The HIT assesses the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR). An abnormal result, characterized by a corrective saccade after a rapid head turn, indicates a peripheral vestibular lesion on the side to which the head was turned.}}|<b>Clinical Utility:</b> A positive HIT is a key finding in the HINTS exam that points towards a peripheral cause of acute vertigo (like vestibular neuronitis) and makes a stroke less likely.|HighYield Test::20-Bas_Donmesi
What is the underlying pathophysiology of Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV)?<br>{{c1::Dislodged otoconia (calcium carbonate crystals) from the utricle migrate into one of the semicircular canals, most commonly the posterior canal.}}|"This condition is known as <b>canalithiasis</b> (free-floating particles) or, less commonly, <b>cupulolithiasis</b> (particles adherent to the cupula).
