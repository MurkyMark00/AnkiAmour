What is the key difference between open-angle and closed-angle glaucoma?<br>{{c1::The accessibility of the trabecular meshwork in the iridocorneal angle. In <b>open-angle</b>, the angle is anatomically open, but drainage is impaired. In <b>closed-angle</b>, the angle is physically obstructed by the peripheral iris.}}|<b>Pathophysiology</b>: The iridocorneal angle contains Schlemm's canal, the primary drainage pathway for aqueous humor.

The link between accommodation and convergence is crucial. In uncorrected hyperopic children, the excessive accommodation required to see clearly can trigger excessive convergence, leading to accommodative esotropia (inward-turning strabismus).

How does the aging lens change in thickness, and what major ophthalmologic condition can this predispose a patient to?<br>{{c1::The lens thickens with age, which can narrow the anterior chamber angle and predispose to acute angle-closure glaucoma.}}|<b>Pathophysiology:</b> As the lens grows throughout life, it pushes the iris forward, progressively narrowing the angle where aqueous humor drains. In a predisposed eye, this can lead to an acute angle-closure crisis, which is an ophthalmologic emergency characterized by sudden severe eye pain, vision loss, and high intraocular pressure.

An elderly patient who previously needed reading glasses (presbyopic/hyperopic) may find they can suddenly read without them. This is because the hardening and increased density of the nucleus increases the lens's refractive index, making it more powerful and shifting the eye's focus towards myopia.

What is the most common etiology of cataracts?<br>{{c1::Senile (age-related)}}|<b>Clinical Presentation:</b> Senile cataracts develop slowly and progressively. Therefore, they are NOT a primary consideration in a patient presenting with sudden, acute vision loss. Other causes include trauma, congenital factors, and systemic diseases like diabetes mellitus. Hypertension is notably NOT a direct cause of cataracts. Source: Slide 12 with handwritten emphasis|HighYield Test::13-Lens_Hastaliklari
Why is the early diagnosis and treatment of congenital cataracts a critical pediatric issue?<br>{{c1::To prevent irreversible amblyopia (lazy eye).}}|<b>Pathophysiology:</b> The visual system develops rapidly in the first few years of life. If a clear image is not projected onto the retina due to a cataract, the neural pathways for vision from that eye will not develop properly. This leads to amblyopia. If the cataract is not removed early (typically within the first few weeks of life), the vision loss can be permanent. Source: Slide 12 with handwritten emphasis|HighYield Test::13-Lens_Hastaliklari
The eye has a total refractive power of approximately 60 Diopters. How is this power distributed between the cornea and the lens?<br>{{c1::The cornea provides approximately 40D, and the lens provides approximately 20D.}}|<b>Optical Principle:</b> The cornea is the main refractive element of the eye. Its high power is due to the large difference in refractive index between air (1.0) and the cornea (~1.38). The lens's main role is in fine-tuning and accommodation, not primary refraction.

What is a common, late complication after an otherwise successful cataract surgery that causes a gradual blurring of vision months to years later?<br>{{c1::Posterior Capsular Opacification (PCO)}}|<b>Pathophysiology:</b> PCO occurs when residual lens epithelial cells on the posterior capsule proliferate and migrate, causing the capsule to become fibrotic and cloudy. It is sometimes called a 'secondary cataract'. Treatment is a simple, non-invasive laser procedure called a YAG capsulotomy to create an opening in the cloudy posterior capsule.

This <b>increases the refractive power</b> of the lens, focusing near objects on the retina.}}|<b>Physiology:</b> This is a parasympathetically mediated process. When looking at a distant object, the ciliary muscle is relaxed, the zonules are taut, and the lens is flattened (minimal refractive power). Source: Slide 8|MediumYield Test::13-Lens_Hastaliklari
What is the primary optical benefit of miosis (pupil constriction) during the near vision response?<br>{{c1::It increases the depth of focus.}}|<b>Optical Principle:</b> Similar to using a smaller aperture (higher f-stop) in a camera, a smaller pupil sharpens the image and increases the range of distances that appear in focus. This reduces the effect of any residual refractive errors. Source: Slide 10 with handwritten emphasis.|HighYield Test::13-Lens_Hastaliklari
The color of the lens changes with age, typically becoming more yellow/brown. What is a potential advantage and disadvantage of this change?<br>{{c1::<b>Advantage:</b> It filters harmful blue light, acting like built-in sunglasses.<br><b>Disadvantage:</b> It reduces the total amount of light reaching the retina and can alter color perception, reducing overall visual quality.}}|<b>Clinical Correlation:</b> This age-related yellowing is part of nuclear sclerosis.

The eyes cannot maintain an eccentric position and drift back to the center (slow phase), followed by a corrective saccade back towards the eccentric target (fast phase).<br><b>Source:</b> Slide 26, 27.|HighYield Test::20-Bas_Donmesi
What is the Head Impulse Test (HIT) and what does a positive result indicate?<br>{{c1::The HIT assesses the Vestibulo-Ocular Reflex (VOR). A positive test, indicated by a corrective saccade to re-fixate on the target after a rapid head thrust, indicates a peripheral vestibular lesion on the side to which the head was turned.}}|A normal (negative) test shows the eyes remaining fixed on the target during the head thrust, indicating an intact VOR. An abnormal (positive) test is a key sign of a peripheral hypofunction, like in vestibular neuronitis. A handwritten note describes the finding as a 'rapid eye catch-up movement.'<br><b>Source:</b> Slide 29, 31.|HighYield Test::20-Bas_Donmesi
A patient presents with vertigo lasting seconds, triggered by rolling over in bed. Hearing is normal. What is the most likely diagnosis?<br>{{c1::Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV)}}.|This is the classic presentation of BPPV, which is the most common cause of peripheral vertigo. The pathophysiology involves displaced otoconia ('canaliths') from the utricle entering one of the semicircular canals, most commonly the posterior canal.<br><b>Source:</b> Case 1 (Slide 34-35), Slide 36.|HighYield Test::20-Bas_Donmesi
What is the diagnostic maneuver for posterior canal BPPV?<br>{{c1::The Dix-Hallpike maneuver}}.|A positive Dix-Hallpike test elicits a characteristic nystagmus: it is up-beating and torsional (geotropic, with the top pole of the eyes beating towards the downward ear), has a short latency, is transient, and shows fatigability with repeated testing.<br><b>Source:</b> Slide 38, 39.|HighYield Test::20-Bas_Donmesi
What is the therapeutic maneuver used to treat posterior canal BPPV?<br>{{c1::The Epley maneuver}}.|The Epley maneuver uses a series of head movements to guide the displaced otoconia out of the posterior semicircular canal and back into the utricle. As a handwritten note clarifies, this maneuver is specifically for the posterior canal and is not effective for the lateral (horizontal) canal.<br><b>Source:</b> Slide 45.|HighYield Test::20-Bas_Donmesi
A patient presents with hours-long episodes of severe vertigo, accompanied by tinnitus, aural fullness, and fluctuating low-frequency sensorineural hearing loss in the left ear. What is the most likely diagnosis?<br>{{c1::Meniere's Disease}}.|This case describes the classic tetrad of Meniere's disease symptoms. The underlying pathology is endolymphatic hydrops (distension of the endolymphatic spaces of the inner ear).

In Meniere's disease management, for a patient with good hearing who has failed medical therapy, what are the next treatment steps?<br>{{c1::Intratympanic (IT) steroid injection, followed by Endolymphatic Sac Surgery (EKC) if necessary.}}|This represents the 'destructive' vs. 'non-destructive' treatment algorithm. For patients with usable hearing, the goal is to control vertigo while preserving hearing. If hearing is poor, destructive procedures like IT gentamicin or labyrinthectomy may be considered.<br><b>Source:</b> Slide 63.|MediumYield Test::20-Bas_Donmesi
A patient presents with a sudden, single episode of severe, continuous vertigo lasting several days, with severe nausea and vomiting. Hearing is normal. On exam, there is a spontaneous right-beating nystagmus and a positive left Head Impulse Test. What is the diagnosis?<br>{{c1::Vestibular Neuronitis (affecting the left side)}}.|This is the classic presentation of vestibular neuronitis, which is thought to be an inflammation of the vestibular nerve, often post-viral. The key features are the acute, prolonged vertigo, lack of auditory symptoms, and physical exam findings pointing to a unilateral peripheral hypofunction (nystagmus beating away from the lesion, positive HIT on the side of the lesion).<br><b>Source:</b> Case 3 (Slide 68-71), Slide 72.|HighYield Test::20-Bas_Donmesi
How is vestibular neuronitis distinguished from labyrinthitis?<br>{{c1::Vestibular neuronitis affects only the vestibular portion of the VIIIth nerve, so hearing is preserved. Labyrinthitis involves inflammation of the entire labyrinth, causing both vertigo and hearing loss.}}|This is a critical distinction. The presence or absence of auditory symptoms is the primary differentiating factor. A handwritten note on the case slide correctly reasoned that if it were labyrinthitis, 'hearing would not be normal.'<br><b>Source:</b> Slide 18, 68.|HighYield Test::20-Bas_Donmesi
What is the HINTS exam and what is its primary purpose?<br>{{c1::HINTS is a three-part bedside eye movement examination (<b>H</b>ead <b>I</b>mpulse, <b>N</b>ystagmus, <b>T</b>est of <b>S</b>kew) used in patients with acute vestibular syndrome to differentiate a benign peripheral cause (like vestibular neuronitis) from a dangerous central cause (like a stroke).}}|A 'benign' or 'reassuring' HINTS exam (positive Head Impulse, unidirectional nystagmus, no skew) is highly suggestive of a peripheral cause. A 'dangerous' HINTS exam (normal Head Impulse, direction-changing nystagmus, or skew deviation) is highly sensitive for a posterior circulation stroke, often more so than an early MRI.<br><b>Source:</b> Slide 75.|HighYield Test::20-Bas_Donmesi
What is the mainstay of treatment for vestibular neuronitis?<br>{{c1::Symptomatic treatment (vestibulosuppressants, antiemetics) during the acute phase, followed by a course of corticosteroids (e.g., 100mg prednisone tapered over 3 weeks).}}|The 2004 NEJM study by Strupp et al. showed that corticosteroids improve the recovery of peripheral vestibular function in patients with vestibular neuritis.

A patient experiences brief episodes of vertigo triggered by loud noises or straining (coughing, lifting). What is the likely underlying pathology?<br>{{c1::Third Window Syndrome (e.g., perilymph fistula or superior semicircular canal dehiscence).}}|This syndrome occurs when there is a pathological third opening in the inner ear, allowing pressure and sound to abnormally stimulate the vestibular apparatus. The classic signs are Tullio phenomenon (sound-induced vertigo) and Hennebert's sign (pressure-induced vertigo).<br><b>Source:</b> Case 4 (Slide 78), Slide 79.|HighYield Test::20-Bas_Donmesi
What audiometric finding is characteristic of Superior Semicircular Canal Dehiscence (SSCD)?<br>{{c1::A low-frequency conductive hearing loss (air-bone gap) despite intact acoustic reflexes.}}|The dehiscence creates a third window, which improves bone conduction thresholds (they can even be 'better than normal') while worsening air conduction. This creates an air-bone gap that mimics otosclerosis. However, unlike otosclerosis, the stapedial reflex is present in SSCD, which is a key diagnostic differentiator, as noted in the handwritten comments.<br><b>Source:</b> Slide 85, 86.|HighYield Test::20-Bas_Donmesi
A 39-year-old male presents with Meniere's-like vertigo episodes, rapidly progressive bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, and interstitial keratitis.
